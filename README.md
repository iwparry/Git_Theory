# Git Theory
## What is Version Control?
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. A Version Control System allows you to compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. The system makes sure that all the team members are working on the latest version of the file.

## What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).

## Why is it used? What are the benefits?
Git is used because it is a free, open-source and is a **distributed** version control system, this means that it has no single points of failure because developers clone repositories on their local workstations, creating multiple copies of the project being worked on with a full history of commits which makes git fast compared to other VCs. One of the biggest advantages of Git is its branching capabilities. Unlike centralized version control systems, Git branches are cheap and easy to merge.

## Why is Git used in DevOps?


## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them. 

## Difference between Git GitHub
- Git is installed and maintain on our local device, whilst GitHub is exclusively cloud based
- Git focuses on version control and code sharing, whilst GitHub is focused on centralised source code hosting
- Git is primarily a command line tool, GitHub is administered through the web
